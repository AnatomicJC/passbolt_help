The team is pleased to announce the v3.6 immediate availability which, as you may already have seen, includes a 
design refresh of the application.

The Pro Edition also includes the most awaiting account recovery feature, also known as secret key escrow. 
This feature is available in “Beta”. While it is functional and have been thoroughly tested and reviewed 
by the team it may still contains some glitches. Moreover the independent security audit for this feature 
is scheduled for Mid-July 2022. We therefore expect to go out of beta at the end of July, once we’ve 
gathered your feedback.

On top of that, this release ships with some more improvements and fixes.
- Performance boost on the client cryptographic operations;
- Additional key validations on setup for better error reporting;
- Experimental support for ECC keys.
- More performance fixes.

We wish to thank the contributors who participated:
- People who answered the account recovery survey and helped us defined how the feature should behave;
- Alpha testers who helped us test the pre-release;
- All the community members who helped with the internationalization;

Next up? We’ll go through a maintenance cycle where we’ll be fixing issues reported in terms of performance (e.g.
adding users to a group, working with large folder structure, etc.), as well as preparing for the migration to 
Manifest v3, and support for PHP 8.1.
