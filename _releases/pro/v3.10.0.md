With the help of our contributors and community, passbolt is proud to present the release of the self-registration feature and the introduction of MFA policies.

Implementing self-registration makes the registration processes smoother and more efficient. Users can now self-register if their email domain matches the policies defined by the admin.

Release 3.10 also sees the introduction of MFA policies. Administrators will be able to manage the authentication policies for their organisations. The enforcement of MFA will add an extra layer of security and a better user experience.

There are many more features to come. As always, we look forward to continuing to refine passbolt with the support of our users and community.
