Release 3.12 for passbolt includes several new features and enhancements. Starting with Microsoft Azure being enabled by default for SSO capabilities. The feature has been thoroughly audited by Cure53, and the issues identified by the community have been fixed.

Another 3.12 improvement is that only administrators can see which users have MFA activated. This ensures that only authorised personnel can access this information, adding an extra layer of privacy.

Users can now configure the output of audit logs to meet their specific needs, namely syslog or file format. In addition, it can now use the action log handler of the users' choice, giving it even more flexibility in log management and analysis. 

Lastly, more file formats for export are included in release 3.12. This provides more options for migrating data between applications.

This release gives users more options while also improving passboltâ€™s functionality and security. Thank you to the community for reporting these issues and assisting us in resolving them.
