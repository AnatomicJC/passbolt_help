This release introduce a new dark theme called 'midgar' that you can use in the place of the black on white
default theme. The goal for this theme was to be easier on the eye for people who stare at the screen for a long
period of time. To switch to the dark theme, click on your profile and select the theme option. 
Let us know if you like it!
