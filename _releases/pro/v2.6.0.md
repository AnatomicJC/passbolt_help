This new release of Passbolt Pro Edition introduces a new workspace for administrator.
In this workspace it would be possible now to enable and configure multi-factor authentication providers.

    legend="Duo and Yubikey providers in admin panel"

Once you have upgraded to the latest version you can follow the documentation to configure these providers
in the [configure section of the help pages]({{ "/configure" | absolute_url }}).
- [How to configure passbolt to use Duo OTP]({{ "/configure/mfa/duo" | absolute_url }})
- [How to configure passbolt to use Yubikey OTP]({{ "/configure/mfa/yubikey" | absolute_url }})

Similarly it is also now possible to configure and run the LDAP directory synchronization.
This interface allows you to define the configuration options such as the Domain, Server URL, Base DN, etc.
For complex schema configuration you would still be required to create a custom configuration file as explained
in the [LDAP help pages]({{ "/configure/ldap" | absolute_url }}).

Another interesting feature for LDAP users would be the ability to filter out inactive users from the sync
as well as specify a filter group. For example you could create a group 'passbolt' in your directory and
assign only the users that you would like to sync to this group. A big thank you to Christoph Grabmer for 
this feature proposal.
