The team is pleased to announce the v3.6 immediate availability which, as you may already have seen, includes a design
refresh of the application.

On top of that, this release ships with some more improvements and fixes.
- Performance boost on the client cryptographic operations;
- Additional key validations on setup for better error reporting;
- Experimental support for ECC keys.
- More performance fixes.

We wish to thank the contributors who participated:
- Alpha testers who helped us test the pre-release;
- All the community members who helped with the internationalization;

Next up? We’ll go through a maintenance cycle where we’ll be fixing issues reported in terms of performance
(e.g. adding users to a group), as well as preparing for the migration to
Manifest v3, and support for PHP 8.1.
