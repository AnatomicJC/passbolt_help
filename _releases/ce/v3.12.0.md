Release 3.12 includes a number of new features and enhancements, including the much-anticipated addition of folders in the Community Edition, which allows users to better organise resources.

Another notable new feature is the ability to customise passbolt to output the action logs in a syslog or a file, giving administrators more control over how logs are managed and reviewed. Users can also implement their own handler for action logs to further customise their passbolt instance. 

Version 3.12 also improves MFA security by ensuring that only administrators can see which users have MFA enabled. Additional export file formats are now available in version 3.12 for use with a variety of services.

Overall, the release of version 3.12 provides several useful improvements. Thank you to the members of the community whoâ€™ve reported issues and helped us fix them.
