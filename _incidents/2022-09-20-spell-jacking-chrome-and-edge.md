## Summary

Security researchers from otto-js published a report about a [spell-jacking security flaw](https://www.otto-js.com/news/article/spell-jacking-enhanced-spellcheck-features-send-pii-even-passwords) found on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Depending on the configuration of the browsers, sensitive data could be leaked to third-party services.


*   **CVE:** N/A
*   **Product affected:** API (Pro and CE) and the browser extension
*   **Version affected:** every version under v3.7.3
*   **Version fixed:** v3.7.3
*   **Affected component:** All form inputs.
*   **Vulnerability Type:** spell-jacking
*   **Severity:** N/A

## Problem

Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge enhanced spell-checking features send the content of (non-password) form inputs to external third-party services owned by Google and Microsoft. Consequently, these browser features break the end-to-end character of passbolt and leak sensitive users' data to third party. 

Furthermore, if a proxy is enabled at an organisation scale, this proxy will also receive this data.

For Passbolt application it means that the following data could have been leaked:

* Account
  * OTP
  * passphrase
  * private key
  * security token
* Navigation
  * Text in the search bar
* Passwords
  * Passwords metadata
  * Passwords secrets
  * Comments
  * Password generators metadata
  * Share password search text content
* Passwords import/export
  * Keepass file password
* Groups
  * Groups name
  * Add group user search text content
* Folders
  * Folders name
  * Share folder search text content
* Tags
  * Tags name
  * Edit password tags text content
* Administration settings
  * MFA settings except salt and secret keys
  * User directory (LDAP) settings except auth password field
  * Passbolt Pro subscription key
  * Organization account recovery public and private recovery key and relative settings (including passphrase)

## Whoâ€™s impacted

The users who are using Google Chrome with the advanced spell-checking feature enabled and the users using Microsoft Edge with the MS Editor extension installed.

## Fix

The fix consists in adding a `spellcheck="false"` tag on the body tag of every page served by Passbolt API and the browser extension.
