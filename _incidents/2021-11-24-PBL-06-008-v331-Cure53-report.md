## PBL-06-008 WP3: JWT key confusion leads to authentication bypass (High) (BETA)

### Summary

As part of the audit of the mobile application, security researcher Johannes Moritz, from Cure53 team, 
while reviewing the JWT authentication procedure, found that the Passbolt API is prone to a key 
confusion attack.

*   **CVE:** N/A.
*   **Product affected:** API (Pro and CE).
*   **Version affected:** v3.3.0
*   **Version fixed:** v3.3.1
*   **Affected component:** JWT Authentication plugin.
*   **Vulnerability Type:** Authentication bypass.
*   **Severity:** High (8.3).

### Attack vector / exploitation

The attacker can change the algorithm field of the JWT header from RS256 to HS256 and misuse the 
RSA public key as HMAC secret key. With the knowledge of another user's id, the attacker can issue 
arbitrary valid tokens and authenticate as other users.

Even though Passbolt only configures the RS256 algorithm, the custom configuration is merged with 
the default configuration by CakePHP. Therefore, both algorithms are supported.

### Fix

V3.3.1 enforces the RS256 algorithm in the JWT header. It is being done by removing the HS256 
algorithm from the JWTAuthenticator instance after initializing the object.

### Severity

The severity of this issue is high. However it is not rated as critical as the plugin is disabled 
by default. Moreover an attacker must know the user id. Additionally the passwords inside passbolt 
are encrypted and therefore cannot be decrypted by the attacker.

If you are currently beta testing the mobile application on your production site you must patch as 
soon as possible or disable the JWT Authentication and Mobile plugins.

### Follow up

We will publish a more complete report once the audit period is completed. Furthermore we reported
the issue to CakePHP team to avoid accidental merge with JwtAuthenticator default configuration.
