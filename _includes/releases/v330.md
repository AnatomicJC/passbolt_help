The team is pleased to announce the much awaited v3.3 which includes new features as well as some fixes requested by the community. It‚Äôs been a while since the last release, but as you‚Äôll see, we‚Äôve been busy!

While browsing the internet, passbolt users don‚Äôt always know how to use the quick access menu in the toolbar to create or use credentials on a given page. The anticipated autofill and autosave improvements, which we call ‚Äúin-form integration‚Äù, has finally arrived. You‚Äôll be able to perform actions faster within web forms, and be able to quickly generate passwords and save credentials.

We‚Äôve also optimized the original quick access flow to provide better accessibility, with more complete contextual feedback and a reduced number of steps (for example, when inserting a password in a page).

This release also contains a revamped password generator, which allows for the customization of the password parameters and introduces support for passphrase generation. The new passphrase generator produces 9 words using the [diceware method](https://www.eff.org/dice). By default, the words aren‚Äôt separated, but the user has the option to define a set of characters (e.g. ‚Äú ‚Äù or ‚Äú_‚Äù) that‚Äôll be used to separate them. The password generator has also been improved, and now generates passwords of 18 characters in length. Also, it‚Äôs now possible to exclude look alike characters, like [Homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph), and even include emojis üòè.

In our continuous effort to make the application accessible by all, in their mother tongue, this release ships with German and Swedish translations. Other languages, such as Dutch, Polish and Spanish, are in the works and scheduled for the end of the year.

Both the password generator and in-form quick access functionalities have been reviewed as part of an independent security audit by [Cure53](https://cure53.de). So, they should be safe for everyone to use! We also completed another series of audits for the API code and cloud infrastructure. We‚Äôll share the results with you soon in a dedicated blog post (spoiler alert: no critical issue found). 

We‚Äôve also successfully completed our SOC2 Type I audit. Our SOC 2 Type II is also well underway and will be available by Q1 2022. These audits are just another step in our on-going compliance and security efforts.

Ok, now for the final reveal. It's been almost a year that we‚Äôve been working on the passbolt mobile application (Android and IOS). This v3.3 release is shipping with its experimental support, which you can optionally enable to test! We‚Äôre currently waiting for the app‚Äôs reviews on the different web stores and we'll publish a blog article to explain how to test the mobile app. The app will be available for general use and enabled by default once an independent security audit is completed by the end of November. Stay tuned!
