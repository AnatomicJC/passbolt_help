This maintenance release involves the Pro and Cloud versions of passbolt. It includes two minor fixes that resolve an issue reported by the community regarding the folders functionality: Users were unable to move passwords out of folders under particular circumstances. 
In addition to the fix, the command line cleanup script will enable administrators to correct integrity shells that may have been caused by this issue.

Thank you to community members who reported issues and helped us fix them.
