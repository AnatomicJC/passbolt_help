The team is pleased to announce that the much awaited “Internationalisation” feature is available to Passbolt Pro, Passbolt Cloud (in progress) as well as Passbolt CE subscribers as part of this release. It is the beginning of continuous effort to provide passbolt in the favorite language of our users. This release ships with the French translation, but other languages such as German and Spanish are in the works.

More languages will come as we go and we are of course counting on the community contributions to keep proposing new ones and make Passbolt available to everyone. If you’d like to contribute and understand how you can translate passbolt in your favorite language, check out the [documentation](https://help.passbolt.com/contribute/translation). We have tried our best to make the translation process fairly easy and accessible to everyone.

This release also introduces a new subscription key management feature available directly from the application’s main administration panel. This feature will help administrators manage their subscriptions more efficiently.

Another aspect of this release is the upgrade of the passbolt API code base to CakePHP v4. This upgrade was necessary and sets the foundations of the new avatars management system, where the users’ avatars are now stored primarily in the database rather than in the file system. This long planned improvement has several benefits among which is a simpler backup workflow as well as the ability to deploy passbolt in high availability.

Finally, the team is proud to share with the community the results of the annual security audit part II performed by [Cure53](https://cure53.de) with a focus on the webextensions. The positive results validate the continuous efforts of the team.

"*The Passbolt extension stands strong and the audit and pentest did not manage to unveil any serious severity bugs, whereas the overall number of problems is also limited to just two minor flaws.*"

A big thank you to [Crowdin](https://www.crowdin.com) for providing us with their amazing translation platform for free. Huge thanks also to the people who have reported and documented bugs on github and the community forum including: @noinlj, @flifloo, @svenseeberg, @Kassouma and many more.
