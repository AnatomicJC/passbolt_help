This release is a minor maintenance release focused on security, performance and compatibility optimization.

It includes some security fixes related to a security audit that was performed by Cure53 on the new account recovery
feature. Long story short, while the security researchers found some weaknesses, no exploitable vulnerability was
found. As usual the full report is available for you to peruse: [PBL-07 Cure53 report](/assets/files/PBL-07-report.pdf).

The performances have also been improved in this release, since the team worked a lot on the group management dialog.
You should notice a 10x improvement in the front-end, while removing users from a group, and a 2x improvement while
adding a user to a group. While we are already working on further performance gains which will be part of an
upcoming release, we already wanted to ship these ready-to-go improvements to everyone, as this was reported
as being one of the main performance bottlenecks in larger organizations. Overall the application should feel
more tidy and snappy on the frontend.

V3.7 ships with compatibility support for PHP 8 including support for [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/hosting/install)
with [RHEL 9](/hosting/install) and [RockyLinux 9](/hosting/install) coming shortly. We also upgraded the front-end to
React v17. It also includes some site-specific fixes for the autofill such as ovh or dzb-bank (feel free to report
more of these on the [community forum](https://community.passbolt.com/) or [github](https://github.com/passbolt)).

Two new languages have been added: Spanish and Lithuanian! Additionally, the translation system has been
improved and is now able to support more complex translations for languages that need multiple plurals (such as Polish).

We would like to thank everyone who participated in the translation on the [Crowdin](https://passbolt.crowdin.com/)
platform, the security team of Cure53, as well Ashley Primo for helping to make passbolt even more accessible and
secure for everyone.
