The team is pleased to announce the v3.5 immediate availability which includes the most awaited launch of the iOS and Android Mobile applications for all passbolt editions, including CE.

Watch the [mobile apps video announcement](https://youtu.be/GETFLtDAcxM) to get a quick glimpse of what’s in it. And let us know what you think in the [dedicated community forum thread](https://community.passbolt.com/t/ios-and-android-mobile-apps-are-live/4790/3).

You’ll be pleased to know that both the mobile apps have been entirely audited by Cure 53 prior public release. The [audit reports are available here](https://help.passbolt.com/incidents/220220118_PBL-06-security-audit-results).

What else is in v3.5? Well, a bunch of other nice things:

- New languages: Japanese, Dutch and Polish.  

- Postgresql support (experimental). The documentation on how to enable it will follow in the next few days.

 - A brand new CLI, written in GO (and [audited too](https://help.passbolt.com/incidents/220220118_PBL-06-security-audit-results)): this CLI is a contribution by Samuel Lorch and supports all API entry points including share operations. It also supports operations related to folders management and sharing as well as Multi Factor Authentication.

On top of that, this release ships with some more improvements and fixes. 

- Due to popular demand, the size of the resource.name and resource.username fields have been increased to 255 characters (previously 64). 

 - The In-Form menu positioning has been improved to appear where it should be with more accuracy. 

 - The overall performance of the api has been improved, primarily due to the optimization of the permissions table which is at the center of many operations.

We wish to thank the contributors who participated:
- [Jesper Schmitz Mouridsen](https://github.com/jsm222), for his much awaited PostgreSQL implementation.
- [Samuel Lorch](https://github.com/speatzle), for his amazing [GO SDK](https://github.com/speatzle/go-passbolt) and [CLI](https://github.com/speatzle/go-passbolt-cli), making it the first fully functional CLI for passbolt since [the other nodejs CLI](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_cli) does not currently support all the operations.
- All the community members who reported bugs and submitted pull requests (weebl2000,  garrettboone) and helped on the community forum to debug issues with mobile.
