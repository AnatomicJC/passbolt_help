The team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of Passbolt version 3.1. 

This release introduces several new features, most notably the ability to update the security token and passphrase as
part of the user settings.

It is also now possible preview a given password using the grid (as well as in the quick access or sidebar) by clicking 
on the little eye icon next to the password dots. This feature is useful in case you need to communicate the 
password to someone out loud or check for a pattern. 

Thank you for your continued support.
