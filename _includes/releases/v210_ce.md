This release includes a major rewrite of the javascript front-end code with an upgrade to CanJS version 3.
We are very pleased by this upgrade as it will also us to ship features faster in the near futures. 

Another simple but notable improvement is the ability to copy the username to the clipboard with one click on the
username in the table view cells or the right sidebar.

Another new feature, during setup, the key passphrase will now be checked against a dictionary using 
the [Pwned Passwords](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2) range API. This secure and anonymous check is only 
performed if the passphrase is longer than 8 character, as any passphrase shorter than this cannot be 
considered secure anyway.
