This release is a small maintenance release fixing issues reported by the community relative to the session expiry. Additionally it was the opportunity to ship a long time requested improvement also relative to the session expiry. When signing in to passbolt and checking the “remember until sign out” checkbox, users will keep their session alive for the duration of their operating system user session or until they sign out manually.

Thanks to the community members who reported issues and helped us fix them.
