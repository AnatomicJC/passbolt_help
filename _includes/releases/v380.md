The team is pleased to announce the v3.8 immediate availability.

This release ships with two new themes, a light and dark Solarized themes. Along with the redesign that occurred 
earlier this year, these themes served as a foundation to propose additional look and feel, but also welcome your 
contributions. If you wish to build a new theme, checkout the blog article: 
[How to create a custom passbolt theme with the UI Kit](https://blog.passbolt.com/how-to-create-a-custom-passbolt-theme-with-the-ui-kit-661f3b19a21b).

In a continuous effort to make passbolt more customizable, administrators will be pleased to find a new administration 
settings screen that will allow them to update the SMTP settings of their organization. More administration screens 
are in the works and will be released very soon. {% if page.product == 'ce' %}Spoiler alert, Multi Factor Authentication is on its way to be released 
in the community edition.{% endif %}  {% if page.product == 'pro' %}Spoiler alert, Single Sign On is the next big thing.{% endif %}

{% if page.product == 'pro' %}
The performances of group management operations have also been improved. You should notice a 6x minimum improvement on 
the back-end while adding a user to a group having hundreds of resources shared with. On another hand, front-end move 
operations were also reworked and you should notice a 10x improvement while dealing with a large dataset. Productivity 
is, along with security, a main priority at Passbolt and the team is continuously working to offer the most secure and 
smooth experience. Please bear with us, more performance improvements are expected with the coming releases.
