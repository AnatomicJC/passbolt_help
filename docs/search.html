Focus on the problem: how would you measure if the problem is solved or the situation better than before?Q2 - Who is impacted?How many people are affected by this issue or how many would benefit from this new feature? Is this for everyone or a specific group?Q3 - Why is it important and/or urgent?Is it strategic? Does it help us achieve your own community objectives? Is it linked to another project that can have a big impact?Q4 - What is your proposed solution? (optional)Use this section to be describe how you would solve this problem if you have a preference or ideas on how to move forward. The more complete the proposal the better, so feel free to add:  user stories. Examples: as a logged in user I receive an email notification when a password is changed.  test scenario in the “given, when, then” format  additional functional / non functional requirements.  screenshots/wireframesQ5.

Personal attacks, hate speech, trolling, baiting, spamming, any intentional form of discrimination, unwelcome sexual attention or imagery, deliberate intimidation, physical threats, stalking or any other kind of bad behaviour will be dealt with decisively.Offenders will be temporarily or permanently banned from communicating through Passbolt’s systems and events or otherwise penalised. These rules may be enforced at the discretion of Passbolt staff by removing issues, comments, blocking or reporting accounts and banning from online or public meetings.Interaction principlesWe pledge to adhere to following principles when interacting with each other:Be respectful: there will always be people with whom we may disagree or find it difficult to cooperate. We will, however, take a deep breath if we need to and then remain respectful.Agree to disagree: decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities and there are many ways of reaching our common goals. If we disagree, we will do so politely.Assume good faith: when we disagree we do not assume the worst, it is unlikely a participant is intentionally trying to degrade the quality of a discussion or product. We will assume best intentions in our interactions.Welcome other perspectives: we actively seek to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. We empower others to speak and will strive to make diversity and inclusion intentional. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community.Be concise: we try to be concise and avoid repeating what has already been said. We try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.Be transparent: we are open about what we are working on to allow others to participate. We are also transparent about our mistakes to allow others tolearn and avoid repeating them.Handling issuesIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email us at contact@passbolt.comDate of Last UpdateThis code of conduct was last updated on November 21st, 2017.",

Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (“UN Convention”) and the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.6.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or understandings.6.3 If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and obligations in the Agreement.6.4 The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.6.5 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.",

Similarly, if you plan to host passbolt in way that it is only accessible on your local machine or network or via a VPN, then the security level is also likely to be appropriate.On the other hand if you have very high security requirements, for example if you are dealing with systems holding credit card information, or if you are a human-rights organisation, you may want to wait before starting using passbolt!In the future we will be publishing a comprehensive risk analysis to give you a complete picture of the threat model.",
