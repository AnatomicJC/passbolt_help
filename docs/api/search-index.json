You’ll be provided with a  template. Please fill it out carefully. The more information the better. Then just submit and make your request.The template closes with the inclusion of a community poll. The community can upvote each other’s requests to help us prioritize.Q1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?Explain with a short paragraph what are you trying to solve with this change request or new feature. Focus on the problem: how would you measure if the problem is solved or the situation better than before?Q2 - Who is impacted?How many people are affected by this issue or how many would benefit from this new feature? Is this for everyone or a specific group?Q3 - Why is it important and/or urgent?Is it strategic? Does it help us achieve your own community objectives? Is it linked to another project that can have a big impact?Q4 - What is your proposed solution? (optional)Use this section to be describe how you would solve this problem if you have a preference or ideas on how to move forward. The more complete the proposal the better, so feel free to add:  user stories. Examples: as a logged in user I receive an email notification when a password is changed.  test scenario in the “given, when, then” format  additional functional / non functional requirements.  screenshots/wireframesQ5.
