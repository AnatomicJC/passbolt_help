"content": "A password manager allows you to comfortably implement best security practices and therefore reduces the risks foryou and your organisation.With a password manager you can prevent your team from reusing the same password on multiple systems.You can also make sure they generate stronger passwords by default, since they do not have to remember them anymore.It also makes it easier to rotate credentials, e.g. help you change your passwords regularly, every 40 days for example.Additionally, having an overview of who has access to what, allows you to reset passwords when somebody leavesyour organisation. Reciprocally it can also help facilitate when someone is joining your team, since a new membercan easily be given access to the all the password they need. It also prevents loss of credentials since you canperform backups.",
