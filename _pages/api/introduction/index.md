Passbolt provides a bunch of REST API endpoints that can be used to access and interact with almost all the aspects of it. Below are detailed documentation of these endpoints, their request/response schema and some relevant code examples to get you started. 

If you are familiar with the APIs and only looking for their implementation details, there is a repo with our latest OpenAPI 2.0 specifications published at:

[https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_openapi_specs](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_openapi_specs)


## Structure of this document

The APIs are grouped around the data that they interact with.
