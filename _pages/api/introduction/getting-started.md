To get started with the passbolt REST API (hence referred to as “APIs”) you need 



*   a running passbolt server instance
*   Ability to use GnuPG (directly or via GpgMe) or an independant OpenPGP implementation in your favorite language. There are various language libraries available that let you do it, like OpenPGP.js for Javascript and Php Gnupg/Openpgp-php for PHP.
*   A passbolt user account if you want to access protected data. Their public, private keys as well as their passphrase.
