A lot of password solutions focus on personal needs. Passbolt is primarily designed for teams and not individuals. We have built passbolt taking into account the needs of small and medium organisations in mind. Moreover passbolt is free, open source and respectful of your privacy. It is also extensible thanks to its restful API.
