Indeed, it is. Wherever possible you should try to have one user account and a unique password per person. 
However it is not always possible, especially for built-in privileged accounts (like the admin password of a 
router, a root password on a linux server, your organization instagram / twitter account password, etc.), 
and this is where passbolt can be of most help.
