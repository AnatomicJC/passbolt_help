If you abide by the license terms, absolutely!

Our goal in selecting the AGPL v3.0, as our default license is to require that the source code is distributed to the end users, so that enhancements can be released back to the community. Traditional open source licenses such as GPL often do not achieve this when the software is runs as a web application, e.g. as hosted application available through a network.

If the AGPL v3 does not satisfy your organisation, commercial licenses are available. Feel free to contact us for more details.
