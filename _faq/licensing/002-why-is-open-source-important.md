Typically, when the source code of a software is not available you need to trust your vendor without having 
any means to verify their claims. For example you do not have any guarantee that they will fix vulnerabilities, 
introduce backdoors or that they will not use your data without your consent. When the source code is 
freely available, anyone can organize a review and check if the level of security the product provides is adequate.
