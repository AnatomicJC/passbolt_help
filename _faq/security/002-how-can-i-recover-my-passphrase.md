At the moment if you have lost or don’t remember your passphrase unfortunately, we cannot help you.
You will be unable to decrypt any existing password. 
If you can’t remember your passphrase, the best thing to do is to start anew 
with a fresh key and ask for your team to share an existing password with you again.
