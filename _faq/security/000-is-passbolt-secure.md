Passbolt is considered as stable and has already undergone [several security audits, like SOC2 Type II](/faq/security/code-review).

It is used by thousands of companies that trust it for storing their passwords. The strict end-to-end and asymmetric encryption model, associated with the robustness of OpenPGP ensure that the solution implements some of the best known standards in terms of security.

We have published a [security white paper](/assets/files/Security%20White%20Paper%20-%20Passbolt%20Pro%20Edition.pdf), explaining passbolt security model in depth.
